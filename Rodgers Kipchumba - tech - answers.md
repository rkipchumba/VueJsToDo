I spent 3 days on the codding test with the first 2 hrs planning and understanding the task. If i had more time i would have added Reminders and self-imposed deadlines, nitifications and emails incase i would like to use it on online activities

I spent most time on the functionality part (scripts.js) because i had challenges on clearing the completed tasks and adding drag and drop functionality

Vue 3 offers us a new feature that allows us to organize components by logical concerns — this feature is called Composition API. It’s an optional feature that allows us to write components in another way using more advanced syntax : 
from
# const  asyncComponent = () => import ('./AsyncComponent.vue')
to
# const  asyncComponent = defineAsyncComponent(() => import ('./AsyncComponent.vue'))

On tracking down performance issues in production i will aproach it in two ways;
    1. Check the console for any resource shortage related messages
    2. Check for the CPU usage of the CICS processes in the system

The test generaly challenging but it helped me grasp some CRUD functionality
